                <h2>Day 1: Chest</h2>
                <p>Working your chest muscles (or pecs) does more than simply improve your physique. These key muscles are involved in essential functions you need throughout the day and provide the foundation for many moves you need in a variety of exercises
                    and athletics</p>

                <h2>Day 2: Shoulder</h2>
                <p>This four-week training plan is designed to help you build the strength to complete a full set of perfect pull-ups. The pull-up is an exercise that it's worth devoting time to perfecting, because as well as strengthening your shoulders
                    it works most of the upper body and core muscles.s</p>

                <h2>Day 3: Back and Biceps</h2>
                <p>Training you back and biceps together is something very common in today's bodybuilding training routines. And, to be honest, it's not for nothing done by the best bodybuilders on the planet.t doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an
                    advanced lifter. </p>

                <h2>Day 4: Legs and Triceps</h2>
                <p>Leg workouts are an important aspect of a balanced, whole-body fitness routine that builds strength, speed, and stability.Lower-body muscles create a strong, stable foundation. Rooting your lower body into the ground helps to create resistance
                    that travels upward into your core and upper body. </p>

                <h2>Day 5: Core</h2>
                <p>Core exercises are an important part of a well-rounded fitness program. Aside from occasional situps and pushups, however, core exercises are often neglected. Still, it pays to get your core muscles — the muscles around your trunk and
                    pelvis — in better shape </p>

                <h2>Day 6: Cardio</h2>
                <p>Another way to think about aerobic exercise or “cardio” is that it's the type of workout where your heart rate and breathing increase, but not so much that you feel like you need to stop and rest after a short period of time </p>
