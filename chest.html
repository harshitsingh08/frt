    <h3>This is a good warmup to prepare the chest for work. Research has shown that a dynamic warmup is helpful in preventing injury prior to training. Lower resistance movements related to those you are about to perform prepares the muscles for work
    </h3>
    <h3>1.Start with your hands on the wall or a countertop height surface. Walk your feet back so that your body makes roughly a 45 degree angle with the floor.
        <h3>2.Keep your body straight and your spine neutral, and lower your chest to the surface youâ€™re leaning against.</h3>
        <h3>3.Pause for a moment, then return to the start position.</h3>
        <h3>4.Make sure the resistance feels light enough to complete up to 20 repetitions. If you need to make it easier, step closer to your hands; to make it harder, step farther away.</h3>
